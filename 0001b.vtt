00:00:08.480 --> 00:00:16.840
Once in the woods on a meadow
a strange fog formed.

00:00:17.560 --> 00:00:24.080
A little wind blew into her,
and there was a doll.

00:00:26.480 --> 00:00:35.720
I don't even know my name!
I will call myself the fairy Amálka.

00:00:37.880 --> 00:00:41.520
Amálka!

00:01:14.640 --> 00:01:18.440
I am pretty!

00:01:19.000 --> 00:01:27.960
I was scared.
Stop, roe deer! Where are you running?

00:01:28.000 --> 00:01:33.000
You are crying? What happened?

00:01:33.040 --> 00:01:43.120
Hunter Fly shot a deer.
And now he's chasing him through the woods.

00:01:44.080 --> 00:01:47.360
Hunter Fly?

00:01:47.560 --> 00:01:54.760
I'll help the deer.
Sit here for a moment and wait.

00:02:04.280 --> 00:02:09.200
I'll shoot you!

00:02:27.400 --> 00:02:37.160
-What are you doing here, doll?
-I'm not a doll, but a fairy Amálka.

00:02:39.720 --> 00:02:46.440
Fly, you have to find healing
flakes of venison on the morning.

00:02:47.680 --> 00:02:55.320
I will not do deer to the doctor.
Get out of my wound!

00:02:56.040 --> 00:03:03.360
Amálka tore the yawn
and whipped Fly over the forehead.

00:03:06.920 --> 00:03:14.760
Then she did a spell
over his rifle.

00:03:15.720 --> 00:03:21.800
Don't worry anymore.
Even if the Fly fires at you.

00:03:33.000 --> 00:03:38.520
I'll shoot you with the first blow.

00:03:41.800 --> 00:03:45.640
If not the first, then the second.

00:04:16.240 --> 00:04:21.480
What is it?
I didn't charge the hornets.

00:05:20.600 --> 00:05:28.600
Hurry up for a healing chip!
Or it will be bad.

00:05:31.760 --> 00:05:36.920
They're already leading him. And it carries a healing chip.

00:05:37.640 --> 00:05:43.720
The fly attached a chip to the wound.
The roe deer was immediately healthy.

00:05:43.760 --> 00:05:48.360
Roe deer and Amálka ran
behind the deer.

00:05:48.360 --> 00:05:55.000
The fly was left alone
with that enchanted rifle.
